# IMS
**This is an Inventory Management System Project built using Python. It keeps track record of items and related transactions in a shop.
The system keeps a record of the following components:
1. Sales record which contains the record of people buying items and the transactions.
2. Purchasing an item
3. Editing an item details
4. Adding new items
5. Expired items
6. Refunding a purchase

The system reads data, manages all these transactions  and the resultant values are stored in the records. Some features are:
- Estimated profit or loss 
- Keeping a count of  remaining quantities of each items so that customer needs wouldn't cause 'out of stock' error.**
